I'm currently an undergraduate student majoring in Electrical Engineering at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/). I'm actively seeking opportunities for a Ph.D. program in EE/CS. My research interests have been largely centered around the design and fabrication of metasurfaces, as well as the application of machine learning in biomedical fields. From 2021 to 2023, I had the privilege to serve as a research assistant at the [Nanophotonics Laboratory](http://nanophotonics.oei.hust.edu.cn/), where I designed metalens array for rotary zoom and metalens array for light detection.
