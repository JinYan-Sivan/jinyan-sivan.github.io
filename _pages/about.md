## Current
I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position in ECE!

## Brief Introduction  
I am Jin Yan, currently a four-year undergraduate student majoring in Electrical Engineering at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/). From 2021 to 2023, I had the privilege to serve as a research assistant at the [Nanophotonics Laboratory](http://nanophotonics.oei.hust.edu.cn/), where I designed metalens array for rotary zoom and metalens array for light detection. In the summer of 2023 and onwards, I was fortunate to work under the guidance of [Prof. Xie at UCSD](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/) on a project that utilizes Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to predict drug interactions.

## Research Interests  
My pevious research interests have been largely centered around the design and fabrication of metasurfaces, as well as the application of machine learning in biomedical fields.
