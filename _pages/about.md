## Current
I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Plasma Physics at UC, Irvine!

## Brief Introduction  
I am a PhD student in Physics at UC Irvine, specializing in plasma physics. I am working under the supervision of [Professor Howard Lee](https://sites.google.com/uci.edu/lee-lab/home) at UCI. My research interests lie in nanophotonics, optics, and machine learning. Before joining UCI, I earned my bachelor's degree in Opto-Electronic Information Science and Technology from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. During my undergraduate studies, I worked with Professor Zhenyu Yang in the [Nanophotonics Laboratory](http://nanophotonics.oei.hust.edu.cn/) on projects involving nanophotonics, metasurfaces, and inverse design using deep learning.

## Research Interests  
My previous research interests have been largely centered around the design and fabrication of metasurfaces and the application of machine learning in physics fields.
