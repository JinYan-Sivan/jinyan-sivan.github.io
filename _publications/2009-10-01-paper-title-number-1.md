excerpt: 'This article mainly studies the power distribution of the rider in the individual time trial and some extension issues (the effect of weather such as wind, the effect of sharp turns). Firstly, regarding the power profile, we introduce a 3-p model, which fits the rider’s power curve data well. Second, a physical model is established through the force analysis of the bicycle. Then, according to the boundary conditions, the problem is transformed into the shortest time control problem. The optimal value is obtained according to the principle of Pontryagin’s minimization. And the last step is to test the effect of the model’s sensitivity to small perturbations.'
